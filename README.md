## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

- **Form Handling:** learned to prevent the form default behavior to ensure it doesn't reload the page on submission, allowing custom JavaScript logic to handle the form.
- **Validation Logic:** I used a regular expression to verify if the email has the correct format.
- **Dynamic UI Feedback:** implemented functionality to dynamically show and hide different elements to have control over the form's behavior and improve the user experience.

### Useful resources

- [How to Build and Validate Beautiful Forms with Vanilla HTML, CSS, & JS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-and-validate-beautiful-forms-with-vanilla-html-css-js/) - This helped me to have a better idea on how to validate the email and how to display a correct error message.
